CodeIgniter4 can be installed in a number of different ways: manually, using Composer, or using Git. Which is right for you?

If you would like the simple “download & go” install that CodeIgniter3 is known for, choose the manual installation.
If you plan to add third party packages to your project, or want to keep CodeIgniter up to date easily, we recommend the Composer installation.
